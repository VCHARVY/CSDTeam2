Introduction

This repository contains a collection of programs and tools essential for understanding and working with system-level programming concepts. These include:

Assembler

A tool to convert assembly language code into machine code.
Includes sample assembly programs and scripts for different architectures.


Linker

Links compiled object files into executable binaries.
Supports resolving symbols, library linking, and memory layout configuration.
Programming Language

Source code for a custom high-level programming language.
Includes syntax, semantics, and examples for getting started.


Compiler

Converts the custom programming language into intermediate or machine code.
Features optimizations and multi-target support.


Virtual Machine (VM)

A lightweight virtual machine for executing intermediate code.
Supports debugging, profiling, and sandboxed execution.


Processor

Verilog/VHDL code for a custom processor design.
Includes testbenches, simulations, and FPGA compatibility.


System Integration

Scripts and documentation for integrating hardware and software components.
Includes examples of bootloaders, drivers, and inter-processor communication.


Operating System (OS)

A simple, lightweight operating system for custom hardware or VM.
Includes kernel, memory management, and task scheduling.
This repository is designed for:

Understanding the fundamentals of system software development.
Educational purposes for students and developers interested in assembly, compilation, and virtualization processes.
Experimentation with low-level programming concepts.
